# 🧠 LeadRank – Prioritize Your Leads Intelligently

Welcome to **LeadRank** – a machine learning-based lead scoring and prioritization tool built to help sales and marketing teams identify high-quality leads from large datasets. 🚀

This project leverages the power of **XGBoost** to predict lead conversion probability and helps businesses focus on the most promising opportunities.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning for sales datasets
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns
- 📊 Feature engineering to enhance predictive power
- 🤖 Model training with XGBoost classifier
- 📈 Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- 💾 Save and reuse models with joblib

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Joblib

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VILAS07/LeadRank.git
cd LeadRank
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Pipeline

To start data preprocessing, training, and evaluation:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:
- Load and clean the data
- Train an XGBoost model
- Evaluate the model and display metrics

---

## 📊 Results

The XGBoost model achieves strong performance in predicting lead conversion likelihood. Evaluation includes:

- **Accuracy**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

📍 Results and visualizations are saved in the `model/` and `eda/` folders.

---

## 🔧 Customization

Want to try with your own dataset?

1. Replace the data in the `data/` directory
2. Update file paths in `main.py` or related scripts
3. Run the pipeline again!
